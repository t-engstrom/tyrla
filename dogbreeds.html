        <p>The Basenji is an excellent breed for owners with nearby neighbors or thin walls. They’re a popular choice for apartment dwellers because they are generally calm and quiet pets. Basenjis are not talkative and they rarely bark unless there is a good reason to do so. These dogs reach a height of 18 inches or more and often reach a weight of more than 25 pounds. They’re a medium sized dog, but don’t require a lot of living space. To keep your Basenji in good health and well toned, take him on a daily walk. The exersise will be good for both of you and it will give you some alone time together to bond. Basenjis love to please their owners so house training and leash training shouldn’t be a problem if you use positive reinforcement methods and are consistent. Basenji’s are minimal shedders so there won’t be a lot of additional cleanup. A weekly grooming is all that your Basenji will need.</p>

        <p>Bichon Frise are a small breed of dog that do not reach heights of more than 12 inches. They, like the Basenji do not shed much and only need to be brushed once or twice a week to keep the coat in good condition. These dogs are energetic and they do need to have one to two walks per day, but they are relatively easy to train for walking on a leash. Bichon Frise are a good choice for people who have allergies because of the low shedding. They are quiet dogs who don’t usually bark unless they are frightened, terribly excited or need something from you.</p>

        <p>Boston Terriers are handsome little dogs who usually reach a height of 18 inches or less. Males are generally on the taller side and females are smaller in size. What makes Boston Terriers such a popular choice for city living is their small size and affectionate personalities. They shed only slightly, and with a weekly grooming, you’ll discover that the shedding is ot a big deal. These dogs are known to be little gentlemen and are easily trained to be well behaved house pets with a gentle disposition. This makes them a good choice for families who have children. The one potential drawback is that Boston Terriers tend to have high energy levels. You can offset this by establishing a regular walking time each day. These dogs do well in leash training and most are easy to house train for toileting. They are wonderful companions who love snuggling and love.</p>

        <p>Dachshunds are hound dogs, but they are the smallest variety. These dogs are easy to identify because all you need to do is look for a pup that is shaped like a hot dog. They are often referred to as “weiner dogs.” They are friendly little dogs with a long body and tiny short legs. They are usually cheerful and friendly pets who love to play and put on a show. If you prefer a dog who is a character, then a Dachshund may be your best bet. Their coats need minimal care and they are easy to train. This intelligent dog loves to learn new tricks. They don’t need a lot of exercise so you can either choose to walk them outdoors on a leash, or let them get their exercise indoors. On a side note, Dachshunds are amazing competitors. They love to race against other dogs in competitions. You may find other Daschund owners at the dog park who have trained their pups to do some very interesting tricks.</p>

        <p>Miniature Pinschers strongly resemble a full sized doberman, but in a smaller version. Your friends and neighbors may actually think that you have a Dobie pup when he’s full grown if you don’t tell them otherwise. This breed is a popular choice for apartment or small home living because they are small in size and adapt well to smaller living spaces. When properly socialized from an early age, the Mini Pinscher can be a good house pet. They are not necessarily the best option for homes with small children. They are great watchdogs because they are suspicious of strangers. This dog isn’t a heavy barker, but will let you known if a stranger is nearby.</p>
